# Next-Word-Prediction-With-LSTM-RNN-GRU-And-Early-Stopping
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Next Word Prediction model using advanced RNN architectures like LSTM and GRU. The aim is to predict the most probable next word in a sequence based on input text, enabling applications in text generation, auto-completion, and conversational AI systems.

1. Recurrent Neural Networks:
LSTM and GRU architectures are leveraged for their ability to learn long-term dependencies in sequential data, effectively handling issues like vanishing gradients.
Comparative analysis of LSTM and GRU to evaluate performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

2. Dataset:
A textual dataset (e.g., news articles, book excerpts, or conversational corpora) is preprocessed and tokenized.
Padding and embedding techniques are used to transform the data into suitable input for RNNs.

3. Model Training:
Sequential models with embedding layers and recurrent layers are designed and trained on the dataset.
Techniques like teacher forcing and dropout are implemented to optimize learning.

4. Early Stopping:
The training process includes early stopping to monitor validation loss and prevent overfitting, ensuring that the model generalizes well to unseen data.

5. Applications:
Text auto-completion in text editors and search engines.
Dialogue generation in chatbot systems.
Generative text tasks like story or poem generation.

6. Technologies and Tools:
Python for scripting and implementation.
TensorFlow or PyTorch for neural network construction and training.
Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) or spaCy for text preprocessing.
Libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization.

7. Goals and Learning Outcomes:
Understanding and implementing LSTM and GRU architectures for sequential data tasks.
Learning how to preprocess textual data and structure it for training neural networks.
Gaining experience with techniques like embedding, regularization, and early stopping for robust model design.
Exploring real-world applications of next-word prediction models in NLP.
